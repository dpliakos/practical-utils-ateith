# Practical utils for ateith students

Let's be honest. The world is great, but it could be better.
You can change the every day life of ATEITH students by solving those tiny little problems that appear every now and then.

## How:

1. Go to `/src/app.js` create an object with an `action` and a `condition` function.

```javascript

var myObject = {
  condition: function() {
    // your code goes here
  }, 
  action: function() {
    // your code goes here
  }
}
```

2. Update the  `listOfActions` to contain your action.

3. Write at the `/src/index.html` what the action you added does.

4. Feel the glory of a real hero.
